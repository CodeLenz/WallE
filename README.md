Bounding Box Optimizer for large problems where the optimal solution lies on the boundary.

It is used for teaching and it is very specific, so you should not use it by now.

This algorith is a very simple Steepest Descent with projection on the Bounding Box. 

I will post the theory behind the algorithm soon.
